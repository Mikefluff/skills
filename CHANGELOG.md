# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill collection are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Commit format follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) — CI parses messages to decide the next bump:

- `feat:` / `feat(scope):` → minor bump
- `fix:` / `perf:` / `refactor:` → patch bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body OR `!` after type → major bump
- `docs:` / `chore:` / `style:` / `ci:` / `test:` → no release

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Distribution pipeline.** `install.sh` (pure bash, curl-pipeable, tarball-based by default; flags: `--skills`, `--copy-from`, `--update`, `--version`, `--prefix`, `--dry-run`). Writes `~/.claude/skills/.skills-collection.json` marker for the update flow.
- **Local dev tooling.** `Makefile` (install / validate / smoke / lint / new-skill / bump-{patch,minor,major} / release). `scripts/validate.sh` (frontmatter + cross-link check), `scripts/smoke.sh` (validate + writer-linter regression), `scripts/bump.sh` (VERSION + CHANGELOG + skills.json), `scripts/new-skill.sh` (scaffold), `scripts/decide-bump.sh` (parse conventional commits).
- **CI / release.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs validate + smoke + install-dry-run on every PR/push. `.github/workflows/release.yml` parses conventional commits since the last `v*` tag, decides bump level, bumps VERSION + CHANGELOG + skills.json, commits, tags `v<new>`, pushes, publishes GitHub Release. Manual override via `workflow_dispatch.level`.
- **Update notification (both A and B).**
  - `skills-update` skill: user-invocable (`/skills-update`) — reads the local marker, fetches latest tag via WebFetch, shows the CHANGELOG diff, confirms via `AskUserQuestion`, runs `install.sh --update`. Never updates without confirmation.
  - `hooks/skills-update-banner.js`: opt-in Node status-line hook — checks remote tag with a 24-hour cache and appends a quiet `· skills v0.1.0→0.2.0 (run /skills-update)` banner. Fails open on any error.
- **Docs.** `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (SOTA layout contract + commit conventions + CI gates + release flow). `docs/VERSIONING.md` (semver policy, bump rules, tag format, yanking).
- **README** rewritten with badges, 5-second install, update flow, project layout, and local dev section.

### Improved
- `scripts/bump.sh` now promotes the accumulated `[Unreleased]` section into the new version instead of inserting an empty placeholder. Future releases will have populated GitHub Release notes automatically.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- Initial release with 5 skills: `writer`, `viral-text`, `prose-edit`, `essay-write`, `style-check`.
- SOTA progressive-disclosure layout: compact `SKILL.md` (≤ 200 lines) + `references/` + `examples/`.
- `writer` ships with an offline regex linter (`writer/scripts/lint.py`) — 23 neuroslop categories, exit-code verdict.
- Cross-skill dependency: `viral-text`, `prose-edit`, `essay-write` invoke `writer` as their final pipeline step; `style-check` routes by file path to the right rule set.
